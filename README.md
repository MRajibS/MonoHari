# MonoHari
MonoHari is an online grocery delivery application, where any grocery shop owner can turn their local business into an online delivery business. In this pandemic, when all people have to maintain social distancing and perform Covid 19 norms, our Application is giving a solution to those local business men who have been affected really worst to help them by giving a platform where customer can put a order and that order will be taken care by these grocery shop owners. This solution can help a customer getting their essential commodities without going outside of their home and as well as give an opportunity to small grocery shopkeepers to sustain their business.
